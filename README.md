# PHP-Productivity-Notes-website
Final year project repository Create tasks, with rich WYSIWYG using TinyMCE document format With website summary api 
Made use of php include to separate sections, the right section is loaded on two pages, home and scenario. 
The sections use their controller. A modular way of creating containers and resizing as needed and including them in any page.
For testing use: 
> **test:hello**  username and password
>> I don't have access to the database anymore! Anything you do with your username or password is permanent.
